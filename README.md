I have created an Ecommerce fashion website(attire hill) using html, css, python, django and sqlite. the user can add to cart products, place orders and make payment. we can upload products details dircetly from the admins website and handle daily orders and 
profit and loss details by downloading the pdf by just clicking on a single button.
